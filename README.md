# AppTrack

AppTrack is a website version of the job application tracking speadsheet that I have been using to keep track of and manage all of the open roles that I have applied to.
This site is built with a Next.js frontend and styled by TailWind

User Authentication:

Users should be able to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. You could use something like Firebase Authentication for simplicity.
Job Application Entry:

Allow users to add new job applications, including key details such as:
Job title
Company name
Application date
Job description link
Status (e.g., "Applied," "Interviewing," "Offer," "Rejected")
Job Status Tracking:

Include a simple system for users to update the status of their applications as they move through the job search process.
Dashboard/Overview:

A dashboard where users can see all their job applications at a glance. You could display them in a list or as cards, with filters for status (e.g., show only "Interviewing").
Notes Section:

Allow users to add personal notes to each job application, such as interview preparation or contacts at the company.
Reminders/Notifications:

A basic system to remind users of follow-ups, interviews, or deadlines related to their job applications.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the website is mobile-friendly so users can track their applications on the go.

Map with pins of all of the places you have applied to jobs, with grouping since you will likely apply to more than one job in a city

I am thinking postgres and prisma for the database - Need to find some online hosted postgres database for a good price since I don't want to work off of a local one.
